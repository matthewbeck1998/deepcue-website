## Description

DeepCue uses a deep Q-learning algorithm to initially learn how to play a game then uses a convolutional neural network to incorporate user guidance in the form of game inputs into the learning process. BGP++ will start by applying DeepCue to Super Mario Bros. In the case of Super Mario Bros, the possible game inputs are left, right, down, A, and B. The user can help the model recognize when to perform actions. An example is a user pressing A to jump when Mario encounters a pit. The goal of DeepCue is to show that a machine learning model accepting user guidance outperforms a model without user guidance in both how quickly it is trained and how well it performs.
